## Description

This is a simple Python-based port scanner that allows you to scan a range of ports on a specified target host to check for open ports.

## Features

2. [Download/Clone] the repository to your local machine.

## Target Host

The `target host` refers to the computer or device that you want to scan for open ports. It can be specified using an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) or a domain name (e.g., `example.com`).

## Starting Port

The `starting port` is the first port number from which the port scanning process will begin. It specifies the lower boundary of the range of ports that will be scanned.

## Ending Port

The `ending port` is the last port number that will be scanned in the port scanning process. It specifies the upper boundary of the range of ports that will be checked.

## Running the Scanner

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `port_scanner.py` file is located.
3. Run the command:
4. Follow the prompts to enter the target host, starting port, and ending port.
